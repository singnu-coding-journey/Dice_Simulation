# ðŸŽ² Dice Simulation in Python

## ðŸ“˜ Description  
This is a simple Python program that simulates rolling **two dice 1000 times**.  
It then calculates and displays the **average outcome** for each die.  
The goal of this project is to practice using **loops**, the **`random`** module, and **basic statistics** in Python.
